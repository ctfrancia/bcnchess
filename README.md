# bcnchess

Barcelona Chess (bcnchess) is a free open source website that is aimed at making meet ups of tournaments within Barcelona/Spain easier. Currently the situation faced is that all the tournaments
are shared through whatsapp which makes it easy to miss one or not know about the others.

### Getting Started
- *IMPORTANT* WHILE RUNNING THE SET UP SCRIPT A NEW USER OF `'chess-web'@'localhost'` IS GOING TO BE CREATED WITH PASSWORD `password`
- Make sure that when starting the server you are passing the flag for `dsn` as this will connect to your local version of the database. The user will need permission to SELECT, INSERT.
- For testing make sure that you pass in the flag `test-dsn` to set for a user that has all priveledges, as we will need to CREATE, DROP etc.

### Goals of this site:
- see list of tournaments
- list a live or online tournament
- shared tournaments through links


### Future goals
- registered members can see who will be attending
- create chess clubs
- chess club managers can manage their clubs
- verification of chess club members (that "John Doe" is the manager or has permission to host chess games at said club)
- More will be added as the site comes online
