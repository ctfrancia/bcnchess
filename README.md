# bcnchess

Barcelona Chess (bcnchess) is a free open source website that is aimed at making meet ups of tournaments within Barcelona/Spain easier. Currently the situation faced is that all the tournaments
are shared through whatsapp which makes it easy to miss one or not know about the others.

### Goals of this site:
- see list of tournaments
- list a live or online tournament
- shared tournaments through links


### Future goals
- registered members can see who will be attending
- create chess clubs
- chess club managers can manage their clubs
- verification of chess club members (that "John Doe" is the manager or has permission to host chess games at said club)
- More will be added as the site comes online
