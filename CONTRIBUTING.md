# How to contribute

Currently at the time of writing this I am the only person contributing, maintaining, etc. So therefore I am really welcoming of anyone that wishes to contribute in any way
I will be updating with bugs, fixes with tags (later) to give a better understanding of what I need help with.

## Guidlines
- If you are submitting anything with a bug-fix/feature/enhancement then tests need to be written for it and attach the ticket number in the PR.
- If enhancing ui or anything like that then this project is mobile first approach as most will be using their phone.
more will be added as the need arises.


## Steps
1. clone repo
2. create branch with feature/bug fix
3. write tests for bug/feature
4. submit PR
